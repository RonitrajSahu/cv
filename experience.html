  <h3>A Brief Description of My Experience</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Working in a Data Warehouse Project for a US bank where my primary role is of an ETL developer. Well acquainted with Informatica Power Centre and Teradata Database. </li>
    <li>Working knowledge of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), having thorough understanding of various phases like Requirements Analysis, Design, Development, Testing and Deployment. </li>
    <li>Well acquainted on various techniques of maintaining slowly changing dimensions (SCD). </li>
    <li>Well acquainted with processing data from various source systems like mainframe, Salesforce, flat files. Data processing through source staging and target staging area. Data transformation between source staging area and target staging area.
    </li>
    <li>I was a part FIS upgrade project where the mainframe system had undergone major change. Due to this, the staging area was realigned. </li>
    <li>Adept in Design, Development and Deployment of DVO (Data Validation Option) Test Cases for Validation of Data on a regular basis against the source data and against other test criteria.</li>
    <li>Efficient in Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of Data Issues raised by Business Users or detected by DVO failures. Resolve the issues by suggesting code fixes, following up with source team in cases where data issues are from their end. </li>
    <li>I have redesigned the Mechanism of Populating the Parameter Files to be used by the ETLs. The parameter file is generated every day dynamically. Earlier the design had provision for only session parameters or global parameters. I have added a
      mechanism to create a section for workflow variables in the parameter file. The workflow variables are much easier to be used in a workflow than session parameters.</li>
    <li>Conceptualisation, Design, Development and Deployment of a Scheduler Program (python and pmcmd) to schedule Informatica Workflows and run them sequentially in a predefined order. </li>
    <li>Conceptualization, Design, Development and Deployment of Data Sync Automation Project to aid the ETL testing team in synchronising the data of test area with the latest production like data available without any manual intervention. Earlier
      the process used to take a lot of time if they have many tables to synchronise manually using Teradata Data movers.</li>
    <li>Conceptualization, Design, Development and Deployment of Batch Alarm & Dashboard Project. The alarm alerts the Support Personnel in case of job failure or job runs for extra time than usual. Earlier the support personnel must fire the support
      query throughout the day to check the batch status. Now the alarm has made the life of the support team easier. The batch issues are detected immediately as they occur. Thus, increasing the quality of support and simultaneously reducing the
      effort spent.</li>
    <li>Design, Development and Deployment of Record Rejection Summary Report Automation Project that used to be a manual activity of 4.5 hours daily. This task is being done without any human intervention, without any error and on time regularly through the automation process. </li>
    <li>Conceptualization, Design, Development, Deployment of Batch Alert Message via Microsoft Teams. This was designed as a second line of defence. The whole team gets a message on batch delays and batch failures through Microsoft Teams. I used selenium to implement this Project. </li>
    <li>Automated Weekly Reports that used to be prepared in MS-Excel workbooks manually. With Python Programming I have automated those so that the reports could be shared without any manual intervention. This saved manual efforts. The project is benefitted. The reports are 100% correct and visually more appealing. </li>
    <li>Designed, Developed and Implemented Automation in Reporting. The support team used to share with clients the snapshots of several types of tabular data obtained through execution of various queries as status of several processes and this used to be a manual task. With use of HTML in mails and Python Pandas, I automated the whole process. </li>
    <li>Designed, Developed and Deployed XLS to CSV conversion project. This was an emergency request from client side as their internal mechanism of converting Excel Workbooks to CSV files through Perl programming broke down. I took the charge and placed various mechanisms to extract CSV files from Excel Workbooks using python libraries. </li>
    <li>Have designed numerous ad hoc file comparison programmes, landing zone scan programmes, etc. based on requirement. These programmes have saved significant manual efforts. </li>
    <li>Overseeing and developing Informatica jobs that process Location Data through IDQ mapplets. The IDQ mapplets use address doctor library for address validation. </li>
    
  </ul>
